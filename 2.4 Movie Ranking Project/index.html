        <h2>My top 3 movies</h2>
        <hr />

        <h3>The Titanic</h3>
        <p>An hall-of-famer for romance</p>

        <h3>The Sound of Music</h3>
        <p>An impressive misucal with subtle showings of love</p>

        <h3>Iron Man 1</h3>
        <p>
            Impressive showing of a futuristic but possible tech.
            And Tony Stark - "genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist" as he described himself, shows an impressive lifestyle many dream of
            Captivating scenes like the opening scene on Tony's attack with his Soldiers, as well as the Dog-fight scene with two F-22 raptors was absolutely mind-blowing.
